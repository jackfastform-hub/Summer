      <h2>Audio Commercial / PSA Assignment</h2>
      <p>This assignment required creating two commercials or PSAs, including writing scripts and recording my own voice-overs. This was my first time working in a professional recording studio, and the process felt quite stressful at the beginning. The most challenging part was keeping the final audio at exactly 30 seconds and successfully blending the sound effects with my voice so that everything sounded natural and smooth.</p>
      <p>However, as I became more familiar with the process, the final result exceeded my expectations. Overall, this assignment was a valuable learning experience that helped me gain more confidence in recording and audio editing.</p>

      <h2>Audio Editing for Film Summative (Ratatouille)</h2>
      <p>This assignment required adding appropriate sound effects to a silent film. I chose to use sound effects from Ratatouille. The most challenging part was incorporating all the details I observed, especially selecting sound effects that matched the actions on screen.</p>
      <p>For example, when seasoning was added in the film, I needed to carefully choose sounds that were similar and realistic. I also focused on using subtle background sounds to enhance the atmosphere of the scene. Although the process was complex and required careful attention, I was very satisfied with the final result.</p>

      <p>For this assignment, I chose the topic of the hidden dangers of TikTok. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of what TikTok is and the major risks associated with it. These risks include privacy violations and data mining, algorithm manipulation, mental health and addiction, as well as misinformation and fake content.</p>
      <p>In addition, I learned some useful safety tips and analyzed the impact of TikTok on people today by reviewing news articles and data. This assignment helped me better understand both the influence and the potential dangers of social media.</p>
