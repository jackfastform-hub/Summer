      <h2>Vector Graphics 1</h2>
      <img src="资源文件夹/vector1.jpg" alt="Vector Graphics 1 Project" title="Basic Shapes & Colors">
      <p>This assignment was my first time working with vector graphics using Adobe Illustrator. In this project, I practiced basic design skills such as changing the size of shapes, adjusting stroke weight, and using different colours to create a complete design.</p>
      <p>This was my favourite assignment in the unit because it was the first project I completed, and I spent a lot of time experimenting with different shapes and layouts. Even though it may not be the most visually advanced piece, it was an important learning experience and helped me build a strong foundation for future vector graphics projects.</p>

      <h2>Vector Graphics 3 (Pen Tool Practice)</h2>
      <img src="资源文件夹/vector3-1.jpg" alt="Heart Shape Design" title="Smooth Curves Practice">
      <img src="资源文件夹/vector3-2.jpg" alt="Dog Design" title="Layer Order & Turning Points">
      <p>This assignment focused on practicing the pen tool in Adobe Illustrator. Overall, the two designs were not very difficult. The heart shape was easier to create because it mainly used smooth and simple curves.</p>
      <p>The dog design was more challenging, especially at the turning points and when adjusting the layer order near the end of the project. This assignment helped me improve my control of curves and better understand how layering works in Illustrator.</p>

      <h2>Vector Graphics Summative Assignment (Ye Zhou Portrait)</h2>
      <img src="资源文件夹/vector-summative.jpg" alt="Ye Zhou Vector Portrait" title="Celebrity Vector Portrait">
      <p>In this assignment, I created a vector portrait of the celebrity Ye Zhou using Adobe Illustrator. I began by setting up the canvas, importing a reference image, and adding proportion guidelines to help with the facial structure.</p>
      <p>I used the pen tool to block out the main shapes, including the face, hair, clothing, and background, and applied flat colours without outlines. I then added shadows and highlights using the Pathfinder tool to build form. One challenge was placing shadows naturally, which I overcame by reviewing classroom tutorials. Overall, this project helped me improve my Illustrator skills and better understand shading and portrait design.</p>
